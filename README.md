## DataMeka - Singapore Housing Price Prediction

### Background
House Hacking: Predicting Singapore’s Housing Prices 
The Singapore housing market has undergone an unprecedented rise in prices in recent years especially since COVID outbreak. Due to this price surge, it is a significant concern for the general population looking for a place of residence, as well as for the government attempting to maintain a stable real estate market. 
Can we use our knowledge of machine learning to predict real estate values in the future? 

### Competition Overview
Data science is not solely about model building. For some business problems, finding insights can have a greater impact than building a high-performing model. Therefore, we have designed the data science challenge with two parts as outlined below:

Participants can choose between two options: (1) Model Building or (2) Business Problem Solving. However, they are also welcome to participate in both.

### Problem Statement
1. Model Building
Build a predictive model to forecast private sector housing prices in Singapore for the next three months.

- Key Granularity: In the train and test dataset, each row has a contract date and a property key that identifies a specific real estate property in the same building with the same size

- Time Granularity & Range
  - Monthly data ranging from 2018 - 2023
  - Train: Jan 2018 - Dec 2022
  - Test: Jan 2023 - Mar 2023

2. Business Problem Solving
Participants are welcome to answer either Question A or Question B, or both For participants answering both questions, higher score will be assigned

[Question A] Price Forecasting Breakdown
Based on your Exploratory Data Analysis with the train datasets, which region(s) underwent the sharpest price increase in the training period?  Why do you think the prices in those region(s) surged relatively higher? According to your prediction, which region(s) will have the highest price increase in the next three months?

[Question B] Undervalued Properties
Is it possible to identify undervalued properties? Please provide your definition of undervaluation and describe which properties fall under your definition

### Submission
1. Model Building
Type: CSV file with the following three columns: 
- property_key 
- contractDate 
- prediction 
How: Click on the "Submission (Score)" tab and drop the prediction file to submit. The columns should match precisely, and all property keys and contract dates provided in the test data must be included in the final submission. Please refer to the sample submission file for the correct format

2. Business Problem Solving
Type: A blog article 
Please make sure your blog article consists of at least 200 words. If you choose to answer both Question A and B, please do so in one article
How: Click on the "Submission (Article)" tab, which will open text editor. Write the article and click on the save button. Temporary saving is enabled and you may edit the article till the deadline (please refer to the timeline). Only you can view your article. Once the winners of the Problem Solving category are finalised, we will post the winning articles with the general audience

### Prizes 
A total prize pool of $600 SGD will be distributed among the top participants as follows: 
1. Model Building
- First Prize: $150 SGD 
- Second Prize: $75 SGD 
- Third Prize: $75 SGD 

2. Problem Solving
- First Prize: $150 SGD 
- Second Prize: $75 SGD 
- Third Prize: $75 SGD 

An individual participant or team is eligible to win prizes in both categories. If you join as a team, the prize will be granted to a team leader. In addition to the cash prizes, the winners will also receive certificates of recognition and the opportunity to present their models and discuss methodologies with a global audience at a live webinar. 


### Timeline 
- ~ 13 April, 2023 - Pre-enrolment (Participants are allowed to explore datasets and share public code, but submissions will not be evaluated) 
- 14 April, 2023 - Submission open
- 27 April, 2023 - Team registration deadline
- 4 May, 2023 - Submission deadline 
- 11 May, 2023 - Announce winners (Email announcement)
- 19 May, 2023 - Prize giving 


### Evaluation 
1. Model Building
The evaluation metric for this competition is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). For a team submission, the lowest RMSE score will be taken as the final submission

2. Business Problem Solving
DataMeka panels, consisting of experienced data scientists and PhDs, will conduct qualitative evaluation based on the following criteria

 a. Data supported evidence: Answers must be supported by strong, relevant data evidence
 b. Creativity: Participants who offer a unique approach to answering the question or who integrate external data sources will be favoured
 c. Visualisation: Quality visualisation assets, such as charts, graphs, maps, must be provided to support the argument

For business problem solving, ONLY the blog article submission from a team leader will be considered for evaluation
